### PokerSim

PokerSim is a program designed to calculate the probabilities of various poker hand outcomes based on user-defined scenarios. The program simulates poker hands by considering factors such as the cards dealt to the player, the number of opponents, and the cards on the table (flop, turn, river).

#### Features:

1. **Probability Calculation**: PokerSim calculates the probabilities of different poker hand outcomes, including straight, straight flush, flush, high card, one pair, two pair, and three of a kind.

2. **Custom Scenarios**: Users can input their own values for cards and suits, allowing for customized simulations of poker hands.

3. **Randomization**: The program includes randomization features to simulate drawing cards from a deck.

4. **Efficient Algorithms**: PokerSim utilizes efficient algorithms for probability calculations, ensuring accurate and fast results.

#### How to Use:

1. **Inputting Cards**: If the user chooses, they can input their own card values and suits. Suits are represented as integers (0 for spades, 1 for clubs, 2 for hearts, 3 for diamonds), and card values are represented as strings ("2"-"10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"). There is also an option for random draws.

2. **Number of Opponents**: Users can specify the number of opponents they want to simulate against.

3. **Dealing Cards**: Users can input the number of cards dealt on the table (flop, turn, river). They can also choose to input the cards themselves or let the program draw cards randomly.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Once the scenario is set up, PokerSim calculates the probabilities of different poker hand outcomes for the player and opponents.


#### Dependencies:

- The program is written in C++ and requires a C++ compiler to build and run.
- No external libraries are required.
